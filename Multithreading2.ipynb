    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to create and manage multiple processes concurrently within the same program. Each process has its memory space, which means that they do not share data by default, offering a higher level of isolation compared to threads. Python's multiprocessing module provides a way to utilize multiple CPU cores and achieve true parallelism, making it useful for CPU-bound tasks that can benefit from concurrent execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of multiprocessing is that it allows Python programs to take advantage of multiple CPU cores, enabling faster execution of CPU-intensive tasks and improving overall performance. Unlike multithreading, which can be limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, multiprocessing allows separate Python interpreter instances to run in parallel, thereby bypassing the GIL and achieving true parallel execution.\n",
